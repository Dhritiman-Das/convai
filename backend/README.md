# Backend Folder

This folder contains the backend code for your project. It is built using Node.js and Express.js, two popular frameworks for server-side JavaScript development.

## Getting Started

To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder and specify any necessary environment variables. For example:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost/mydatabase
   ```

   Modify the values based on your specific configuration.

5. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running on the specified port, and you can access it via `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the backend code is as follows:

- `index.js`: The entry point of the application where the server is created and configured.
- `routes/`: This folder contains the route handlers for different API endpoints. You can add or modify routes based on your application's requirements.
- `controllers/`: Here, you can define the controller functions that handle the business logic for each route.
- `middlewares/`: This folder holds custom middleware functions that can be used for request processing.
- `models/`: You can define your data models or schemas in this folder if you are using a database.
- `config/`: This folder can contain any configuration files or modules that your application requires.
- `utils/`: If there are any utility functions or helper modules, you can place them in this folder.

Feel free to modify and organize the folder structure based on your project's needs.

## Additional Information

- If you need to make changes to the server configuration, refer to the `index.js` file and the relevant documentation for Node.js and Express.js.
- If you are using a database, make sure to configure the appropriate connection settings and update the corresponding model and controller files.
- Remember to secure any sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys by using environment variables or other secure methods.

For more information or assistance, please refer to the documentation for Node.js, Express.js, and the specific modules or libraries you are using.

Happy coding!
